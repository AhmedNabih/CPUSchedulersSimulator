# CPUSchedulersSimulator
* It's a project that simulate CPU in scheduling it's processes.
* A simple GUI will be created to show the sumulation.

# Algorithm to simulate
* Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF).
* Shortest- Remaining Time First (SRTF)  Scheduling  using context switching.
* Non-preemptive  Priority Scheduling with starvation solution.
* Round Robin (RR) algorithm with modifcation "Deatils will be provided soon".

# Requirements to Modify this project
* Java 8+
* JFrame installed
